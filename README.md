# Mini Account Management System

Mini Account Management System is a simple yet powerful web-based platform designed to help businesses manage their financial records efficiently. Developed using ASP.NET Core Razor Pages and SQL Server with stored procedures (no LINQ or Entity Framework), this system supports role-based access, organized account structures, voucher management, and essential financial reporting.

---

## Overview

The Mini Account Management System is built to simplify financial recordkeeping for businesses by offering secure, role-based access to key accounting features. Users can manage a structured chart of accounts, enter and track vouchers, and generate basic financial reports. The system supports three distinct user roles (Admin, Accountant, and Viewer) each with specific access permissions tailored to their responsibilities.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core 8 (Razor Pages)**
- **MS SQL Server** (Stored Procedures only)
- **ASP.NET Identity** (Authentication + Role Management)
- **Bootstrap 5**
- **jQuery + Datatbles**

## User Roles and Permissions

Each user role has specific access to system modules based on their responsibilities:

| Role       | Admin Panel | Chart of Accounts | Vouchers | Reports |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|----------|---------|
| Admin      | Yes         | Yes               | Yes      | Yes     |
| Accountant | No          | Yes               | Yes      | Yes     |
| Viewer     | No          | No                | No       | Yes     |


- Authorization enforced using `[Authorize(Roles = "...")]` attributes
- Sidebar UI dynamically adjusts based on role

## Authentication

- Built with ASP.NET Core Identity for handling user authentication and authorization.
- Roles (Admin, Accountant, Viewer) are manually assigned by the Admin.
- Access to each module is restricted based on the user's assigned role.
- User sessions are managed securely using token and cookie-based authentication mechanisms provided by ASP.NET Identity.
